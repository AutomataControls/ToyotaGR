  🏎️ PROJECT OVERVIEW

  Vision Statement

  "Transform raw telemetry into winning strategies through
  the power of specialized AI ensemble networks"

  Core Concept

  ORIS adapts the proven OLYMPUS multi-specialist ensemble
  architecture to racing analytics:
  - MINERVA → Strategic race analysis & optimal pit window
  calculation
  - ATLAS → Track mapping & racing line optimization
  - IRIS → Visual telemetry pattern recognition & anomaly
  detection
  - CHRONOS → Temporal sequence analysis & tire degradation
  prediction
  - PROMETHEUS → Creative strategy generation & what-if
  scenario modeling

  📊 TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

  🔧 System Components

  1. Data Ingestion Pipeline
  - Real-time telemetry streaming (simulated from historical
   data)
  - Multi-source data fusion (lap times, sensor data,
  weather, track conditions)
  - Automatic data validation and cleaning
  - 100Hz+ sampling rate support

  2. OLYMPUS Racing Ensemble
  - Input: Normalized telemetry vectors (speed, RPM,
  throttle, brake, steering, tire temps, fuel load)
  - Processing: 5 specialized networks analyze different
  aspects simultaneously
  - Output: Unified strategic recommendations with
  confidence scores
  - Update Rate: <100ms for real-time decisions

  3. Strategic Decision Engine
  - Pit stop optimization (when, what tires, fuel quantity)
  - Racing line suggestions based on current conditions
  - Overtaking opportunity identification
  - Caution flag strategy recommendations
  - Tire management guidance
